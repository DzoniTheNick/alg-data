# alg-data
This project consists of multiple mini projects which I had to do for my Algorithms and Data Structures class

# How to compile
	Make sure that you have Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK) on your machine [link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/]

Steps:

	1) Unpack the zip folder in any location that you like
	2) Using a CLI (i.e. CMD for Windows) direct yourself to the src folder of the project (i.e. ../AD_A2/src)
	3) Make sure that the Node, LinkedList, Queue, Graph and Program are in the directory you are looking at. They should with an .java extension
	4) While in the CLI type <javac Program.java>. This should then generate all of the required classes. 
	5) Type in the command <java Program> to start the program.

Additional Notes:
	
	1) The programs output is displayed on the CLI itself and the user can quit it anytime he/she likes by entering <0>. Also, it is expected that the
	   program recives a absolute directory to the letters and edges of the graph when first initializing it.
	2) Files such as letters.txt, letter_edges.txt, etc. are example files of .txt input files should look if a user wishes to enter his own files.
